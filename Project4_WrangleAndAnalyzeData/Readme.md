# Project 4 - WeRateDogs Data Wrangling and Analysis

Dive into the delightful world of doggos with my project, "WeRateDogs Data Wrangling and Analysis." Through this enchanting endeavor, I embarked on the captivating journey of gathering, assessing, and cleaning the whimsical Twitter archive of @dog_rates, popularly known as WeRateDogs. 
With a passion for data science, I meticulously wrangled the provided dataset, storing it in a CSV file, and unleashed the power of visualization to uncover the enchanting tales hidden in these canine-centric tweets. Join me in this heartwarming escapade as we reveal the endearing charm of our furry friends!
