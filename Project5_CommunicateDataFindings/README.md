# Ford GoBike Data Set Analysis
## by Shanshan Chu


## Dataset

> The data set that I analyzed includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system (Ford GoBike) covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The data includes information about each trip for Ford GoBike (e.g. the start and end time, the start and ending station) and user information (e.g. user's subscription status and ages). The data exploration of this data set gives us some insights about the bike-sharing marking in the greater San Francisco Bay area.


## Summary of Findings

> User background: The most users for Ford GoBike are around 20 to 40 years old, male. Most of the users are subscribers.

> Using time: The most bike using time is on weekdays during rush hours for work.

> Usage duration: despite those extremely long and short usage, most users use the bike less than 40 minutes. Gender and user type does not have a large impact on the duration time.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> In my presentation, I mainly present the key findings of my analysis, including the plot which clearly shows the user background, using time and Usage duration.

> For user background, I showed the users' age distribution, genders, and subscribe status.

> For using time, I showed the users' start/end time in the scale of both 24 hours and 7 days.

> For Usage duration, I used the plot of the duration for different gender and user types as example, to demonstrate the point that gender and user type does not have a large impact on the duration time.
