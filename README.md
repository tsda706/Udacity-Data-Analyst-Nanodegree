# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree
I am currently a Ph.D. students at Duke University. My research experience in stochastic modeling gradually brings me with new interest in data science. I prefer to learn data science in a more systematic and job-oriented way, so I joined Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program. The files in this resipotory are projects that I completed. These are also records which represent my study progress.
